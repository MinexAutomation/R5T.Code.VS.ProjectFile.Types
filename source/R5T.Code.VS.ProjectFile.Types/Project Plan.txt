# Overview - Project File

A project file is just an XML file with various nodes with various attributes.

However, after reading in a file, there are two approaches taken to the in memory data-structure of the project file. Is the memory model of a project file a:

1. A System.Xml.XmlDocument

	* Different parts of a project file are provided as descendents of TypedXmlElement, selected by XPath expressions.
	* De/Serialization is performed by XmlDocument.Load() and XmlDocument.Save(FileStream).

2. A System.Xml.LINQ.XElement

	* Different parts of a project file are provided as descendents of TypedXElement.
	* De/Serialization is performed by XElement.Load() and XElement.Save(FileStream).

Further, should this "raw" representation of the project file (really just XML-specific datastructures) be converted to some custom representation?
